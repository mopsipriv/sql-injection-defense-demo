# SQL Injection Defense Demo (Flask + SQLite)

This is an educational project created by a student to
understand common web security vulnerabilities and how to
prevent them in practice.

The project demonstrates:
- how insecure SQL queries can lead to authentication bypass
- how to properly fix SQL Injection using prepared statements
- basic detection and logging of suspicious input patterns

⚠️ This project is intended strictly for educational and
defensive security learning purposes.
This project does not target any real systems and uses
only a local test environment.

## Learning outcome

- Understanding why SQL Injection happens
- Learning secure database access patterns
- Applying defensive coding techniques
- Basic awareness of attack detection
